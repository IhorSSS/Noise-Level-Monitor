        severity="Information"
        message="161 errors and 85 warnings were filtered out because they are listed in the baseline file, lint-baseline.xml"
        category="Lint"
        priority="10"
        summary="Baseline Applied"
        explanation="Lint can be configured with a &quot;baseline&quot;; a set of current issues found in a codebase, which future runs of lint will silently ignore. Only new issues not found in the baseline are reported.&#xA;&#xA;Note that while opening files in the IDE, baseline issues are not filtered out; the purpose of baselines is to allow you to get started using lint and break the build on all newly introduced errors, without having to go back and fix the entire codebase up front. However, when you open up existing files you still want to be aware of and fix issues as you come across them.&#xA;&#xA;This issue type is used to emit an informational-only warning if any issues were filtered out due to baseline matching. That way, you don&apos;t have a false sense of security if you forgot that you&apos;ve checked in a baseline file.">

        id="LintBaselineFixed"
        severity="Information"
        message="1 errors/warnings were listed in the baseline file (lint-baseline.xml) but not found in the project; perhaps they have been fixed? Another possible explanation is that lint recently stopped analyzing (and including results from) dependent projects by default. You can turn this back on with `android.lintOptions.checkDependencies=true`. Unmatched issue types: NewApi"

        priority="10"
        summary="Baselined Issues Fixed"
        explanation="If a lint baseline describes a problem which is no longer reported, then the problem has either been fixed, or perhaps the issue type has been disabled. In any case, the entry can be removed from the baseline (such that if the issue is reintroduced at some point, lint will complain rather than just silently starting to match the old baseline entry again.)">

        id="InlinedApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Field requires API level 28 (current min is 21): `android.Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE`"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Using inlined constants on older versions"
        explanation="This check scans through all the Android API field references in the application and flags certain constants, such as static final integers and Strings, which were introduced in later versions. These will actually be copied into the class files rather than being referenced, which means that the value is available even when running on older devices. In some cases that&apos;s fine, and in other cases it can result in a runtime crash or incorrect behavior. It depends on the context, so consider the code carefully and decide whether it&apos;s safe and can be suppressed or whether the code needs to be guarded.&#xA;&#xA;If you really want to use this API and don&apos;t need to support older devices just set the `minSdkVersion` in your `build.gradle` or `AndroidManifest.xml` files.&#xA;&#xA;If your code is **deliberately** accessing newer APIs, and you have ensured (e.g. with conditional execution) that this code will only ever be called on a supported platform, then you can annotate your class or method with the `@TargetApi` annotation specifying the local minimum SDK to apply, such as `@TargetApi(11)`, such that this check considers 11 rather than your manifest file&apos;s minimum SDK as the required API level."

        summary="Calling new methods on older versions"
